# Reinforcement-Learning
This project is all about planning a path using Reinforcement Learning. 
The input for the agent is ultrasonic sensor reading (Distance as a state).

Here in this project, Q-Learning reinforcement learning algorithm is used which updates the Q-table 

The agent is trained in virtual environment
Simulator : Webots Simulators 
Bot in Simulator : Custom Bot

Pretrained Q-table is used to drive the bot in real time with exact simulation environment.
